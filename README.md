# sinatra-assessment â€” GearTracker

This repository contains GearTracker, my project for the final Sinatra assessment in the Learn-Verified program at the Flatiron School. GearTracker is a CRUD (create, read, update, delete) web app with user accounts and encrypted passwords.

To start up GearTracker on your home machine for testing purposes, clone this repository, make sure it is your current working directory (using `cd` or another command), and then run `shotgun` from the command line (e.g., Terminal). GearTracker will accept incoming requests on port 9393 of your network, so go to `localhost:9393` to create an account and use the app after running `shotgun`.

# Contributing

If you are interested in developing GearTracker further, please fork this repository and make whatever improvements interest you (e.g., additional models or validations, further front-end styling), then submit a pull request. I welcome any additional contributors or input.
